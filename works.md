The term first responders usually refers to law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical personnel. These responders, however, are not the only assets that may be required in the aftermath of a strike on the homeland. In contrast, the more appropriate term, emergency responders, comprises all personnel within a community that might be needed in the event of a natural or technological (man-made) disaster or terrorist incident. These responders might include hazardous materials response teams, urban search and rescue assets, community emergency response teams, anti-terrorism units, special weapons and tactics teams, bomb squads, emergency management officials, municipal agencies, and private organizations responsible for transportation, communications, medical services, public health, disaster assistance, public works, and construction. In addition, professional responders and volunteers, private nonprofit, nongovernmental groups (NGOs), such as the Red Cross, can also play an important role in emergency response. As a result, the tasks that a national emergency response system would be required to perform are more complex than simply aiding victims at the scene of a disaster, carried out by several kinds of professional users with different roles and expertise. Moreover, emergency preparedness and response lifecycle is a complex process that consists of the preparation, response, and recovery from a disaster, including planning, logistical support, maintenance and diagnostics, training, and management as well as supporting the actual activities at a disaster site and post-recovery after the incident.</dd></dl>

<h4><a target="_blank" href="#">INGENIOUS</a>: "The First Responder (FR) of the Future: a Next Generation Integrated Toolkit (NGIT) for Collaborative Response, increasing protection and augmenting operational capacity" (<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/222613/factsheet/en" target="_blank">n.833435</a>)</h4>

<dl><dt><strong>Description:</strong></dt><dd>
Today’s First Responders (FR) are using technology of the past. During their primary mission of saving lives and preserving
society’s safety and security, FRs face a multitude of challenges. In both small scale emergencies and large scale disasters,
they often deal with life-threatening situations, hazardous environments, uncharted surroundings and limited awareness.
Threats and hazards evolve rapidly, crossing municipalities, regions and nations with speed and ease. Armouring public
safety services with all the tools that modern technology has to offer is critical. Such tools holistically enhance their
protection and augment their operational capacities, assisting them in saving lives as well as ensuring their safe return from
the disaster scene. INGENIOUS will develop, integrate, test, deploy and validate a Next Generation Integrated Toolkit
(NGIT) for Collaborative Response, which ensures high level of Protection & Augmented Operational Capacity to respond to
the disaster scene. This will comprise a multitude of the tools and services required: 1) for enabling protection of the FRs
with respect to their health, safety and security; 2) for enhancing their operational capacities by offering them with means to
conduct various response tasks and missions boosted with autonomy, automation, precise positioning, optimal utilisation of
available resources and upgraded awareness and sense-making; 3) for allowing shared response across FR teams and
disciplines by augmenting their field of view, information sharing and communications between teams and with victims. The
NGIT armours the FRs at all fronts. The NGIT will be provided at the service of the FRs for extensive testing and validation
in the framework of a rich Training, Testing and Validation Programme – of Lab Tests (LSTs), Small-Scale Field Tests
(SSTs) and Full-Scale Field Validations (FSXs) – towards powering the FR of the future being fully aware, fully connected
and fully integrated.</dd></dl>
